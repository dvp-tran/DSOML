## Obj. :
Implement the SDCA algorithm to estimate support Vector Machines. Test the algorithm on databases of your choice and compare it with a subgradient descent.

## Before starting :
- the notebooks contain both codes and interpretations.
- data files which are used for the benchmarks are stored in the data folder.
